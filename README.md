# Flutter Neomorphism UI

A new Flutter project on neomorphism UI 

# Neomorphism -
_Neumorphism (aka neomorphism) is a relatively new design trend and a term that’s gotten a good amount of buzz lately. It’s aesthetic is marked by minimal and real-looking UI that’s sort of a new take on skeuomorphism — hence the name._

Now you have got it that this is brand new design for application as well as web and it is soft and light weight design .

Because it totally new So i thought to make and share this to everyone and use it it is very simple .Only CSS tricks is necessary .

```
BoxShadow(
      color: Colors.white.withOpacity(0.5),
      spreadRadius: -5,
      offset: Offset(-5, -5),
      blurRadius: 30),
  BoxShadow(
      color: Colors.blue[900].withOpacity(0.2),
      spreadRadius: 2,
      offset: Offset(7, 7),
      blurRadius: 20)
```

This is the main CSS game for this soft UI.
